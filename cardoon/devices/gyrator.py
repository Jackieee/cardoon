    Gyrator
    -------

    The gyrator converts Port 1 voltage into Port 2 current and
    *vice-versa*. Combined with the VCCS device it can be used to
    implement all the remaining controlled sources:

      * VCVS = VCCS + gyrator
      
      * CCCS = gyrator + VCCS

      * CCVS = gyrator + VCCS + gyrator
