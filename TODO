Development Plan (TODO file)
----------------------------

Short-term goals:

  #. Add support for convolution of frequency defined elements 
  
  #. Finish implementation of nodal analysis of independent subcircuits

Longer term goals and other tasks to be done at some time:

  * Convert into Python library with easy-to-use setup script and
    re-organize executable behaviour

  * Consider changing saveOP interface (return value?) for nonlinear devices
  
  * Add netlist variable sweep in DC analysis
  
  * Implement time-step control in transient analysis

  * Implement Harmonic Balance analysis (or equivalent)

  * Add "+" notation for multiple lines in parser 
  
  * Implement sparse-matrix-based AC analysis

Housekeeping and refinement:

  * Handle RuntimeWarnings more gracefully. Currently RuntimeWarnings
    are suppressed when the AD tapes are being cleated/evaluated as
    some of the functions may have invalid arguments. This should have
    no effect in results.

  * Check for repeated terminals ins subcircuit definitions (should
    this be allowed or not?)

  * Consider re-naming ``neighbour`` and ``nodeName`` in Graph class
    to something more circuit-specific: ``connections`` and
    ``instanceName``.

  * Review handling of hierarchical simulation: currently a copy of
    the definition of each subcircuit instance is needed by the nodal
    module to store nodal voltages, time-delayed variables,
    etc. Possible solutions: (1) cloning of subcircuit definitions
    (one per instance) or (2) allow sharing of nodal attributes in the
    same circuit definition (for use with different instances)
