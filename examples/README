Examples Directory
------------------

The ``examples`` directory contains ready-to-use netlist
examples. They all should work with no errors. To run netlists,
execute the following command::

  cardoon/examples$ ../cardoon.py <netlist file>

Brief description of each file:

 #. ``inverter.net``: Basic CMOS inverter from documentation (DC sweep)

 #. ``npn_thermal.net``: Electro-thermal BJT test from documentation
    (DC sweep). Simulation drops to an ipython shell at the end. Results
    can be explored with more detail in this mode. Type ``quit()`` to
    exit this shell.

 #. ``oscillator.net``: Colpitts oscillator from documentation (transient)

 #. ``ring_osc_ahkab.net``: CMOS ring oscillator similar to the
    example provided with the ahkab <http://code.google.com/p/ahkab/>
    simulator.

 #. ``summing_lm741.net``: transistor-level LM741-based summing
    amplifier (transient)

 #. ``thermal_rf_amp_AC.net``: RF amplifier with transmission lines (AC sweep)

 #. ``soliton.net``: Nonlinear transmission line transient
    simulation. This simulation takes approximately 5 minutes to
    complete.

 #. ``lma411.net``: X-Band MMIC amplifier. 

 #. ``memductor.net``: illustrates the behaviour of a memductor and
    how to use simulation results in an interactive shell
